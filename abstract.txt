The aim of this work is to examine the applicability of an algorithm for
approximate frequency counting to act as an on-the-fly filter in the process of phrase
table extraction in Statistical Machine Translation systems. Its implementation al-
lows for the bulk of extracted phrase pairs to be much reduced with no significant
loss to the ultimate quality of the phrase-based translation model as measured by the
state-of-the-art evaluation measure BLEU. The result of this implementation is a fully
working program, called eppex, capable of acting as an alternative to the existing tools
for phrase table creation and filtration that are part of the open-source SMT system
Moses. A substantial part of this work is devoted to the benchmarking of both the run-
time performance and the quality of produced phrase tables achieved by the program
when confronted with parallel training data comprised of 2 billions of words.
