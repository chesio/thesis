It has been more than two years now since I met Ondřej Bojar and together
we arranged the topic of this work to be the assignment of my master thesis.
In the whole time that followed, I have received substantial help
from his side, so at this point, I want to sincerely thank him for all the
valuable advice he gave me and his responsiveness to my questions.

I also want to thank my parents for their patience, and all the others who have
supported me, especially my girlfriend M.

A special thanks go to Micheal Ua Seaghdha for proof-reading the thesis and
correcting the hundreds of grammar errors I have made.

On a more personal note, I would like to express my gratitude to the band Porcupine Tree
for their great music that managed to replenish my mental energy countless times.
