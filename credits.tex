It has been more than two years now since I met with Ond≈ôej Bojar and together
we arranged the topic of this work to be the assignment of my master thesis.
For the whole time that followed, I have been receiver of a substantial help
from his side, so at this point, I want to sincerely thank him for all the
valuable advices he gave me and his responsiveness to my questions.

I want also to thank my parents -- for their patience. And all the others,
who have supported me, especially my girlfriend M.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the band Porcupine Tree
for their great music that I had listened to for hundreds of hours while
I was working on this thesis.
